it's the year 2277. 200 years ago the Great war begun, all major countries started attacking eachtother with nuclear bombs and in just 2 hours the world as we knew it was destroyed. Because war, war never changes Most of humanity eather died or servived by being outside the bombs radius or by taking shelter in nuclear underground shelters called Vaults.
Vaults dewellers would leave the vaults when it was safe outside, except for valt 101, there... once the door was closed it never opened again, it's here you are born, it's her you will die. War, war never changes.
